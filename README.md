# Age pack obsidian

## About
This repo contains the obsidian markdown files for the age pack.

All the stuff here is being used to organize and plan the age pack

## Age pack repo
https://github.com/haloreach252/age-pack/tree/main

## Contributing
Currently the only people who will have access to push/pull are people working on the modpack

## Updating
Whenever changes are made to the vault, please run "py makesite.py" in the root directory to build the github pages site before you push
This allows the github pages site to be up to date with any new information

Note: The script requires 2 pip packages (markdown and jinja2) to install, follow directions below (in the future I'll create a python env for the repo)
markdown: pip install markdown
jinja2: pip install jinja2
